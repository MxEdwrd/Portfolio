            <p style="font-size: 18px; padding-bottom: 10px">
              In February of 2020, I was hit by a stop-sign runner on my motorcycle. This accident had shattered my right ankle and broke my right tibia and fibula. For the next 6 months,
              I was laid up in bed and unable to walk or use my right leg. This had motivated me to design and create the MaxLeg.
            </p>
            <div style="padding: 30px 0px">
                <img src="../Images/MaxLeg.PNG" alt="" />
            </div>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; padding-bottom: 10px">
              The Maxleg is a brace-like device that attaches to the knee and lower leg and allows mobility on a leg that would otherwise not be able to be walked on. 
              It is interchangeable from right to the left leg so it can be used on either. Most of the device is made of 3D printed plastic, however, there are places where PVC and old shoe sole
              were used as they proved to provide better strength and comfort.

            <p style="font-size: 18px; padding-bottom: 10px">
                I had used this brace until I was able to walk on my leg like normal and start physical therapy. This device had proven to be a fantastic design and had helped me heal
                happier with mobility. Not only was it a great apparatus, but it had gotten the attention of lots of people and spread the word of my design skills.
              </p>
            <h1 style="font-size: 30px; padding-top: 30px;">MaxMask</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; padding-bottom: 10px">
              With the spread of COVID-19 and the beginning of masks becoming widely worn and needed, I was hired by a previous mentor of mine to design and create a mask design that would allow
              maximum protection from outside elements while still allowing for high breathability. This was the start of the MaxMask.
            </p>
            <div style="padding: 30px 0px">
              <img src="../Images/MaxMaskRed.PNG" alt="" />
            </div>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; padding-bottom: 10px">
                The first designs of the MaxMask were very rough and abstract. I had never designed a mask before and one that had to conform to the human face - a very complex and varying
                surface - was quite a challenge. The first designs looked like a part of a hazmat suit or were too flimsy to hold up well and required sewing in order to attach the filter 
                material to the mask shell.
                </p>
                    <div class="container projectsgrid-2">
                        <div style="padding: 30px 0px">
                            <img src="../Images/FirstDesignMask.jpg" alt="" />
                        </div>
                        <div style="padding: 30px 0px">
                            <img src="../Images/SecondDesignMask.jpg" alt="" />
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; padding-bottom: 10px">
              However, after weeks of work and design changes, I had come up with a design that conformed well to the human face
              while also allowing for maximum breathability. With that, the MaxMask was created. We had sent these masks with
              filters to healthcare workers and local clinics who were not able to get new masks during the shortage and had to reuse dirty surgical masks.
